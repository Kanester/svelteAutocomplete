Svelte Completer for Acode

A lightweight Acode plugin that provides auto-completion for Svelte components, directives, and APIs into your Svelte or SvelteKit project.

---

🚀 Usage

1. Open a Svelte project in Acode (i.e., a folder containing svelte.config.js or svelte.config.cjs).

2. Open any .svelte file.

3. The plugin will automatically detect that you are in a Svelte project and activate the Svelte completer.

4. Start typing in the editor, and you’ll see Svelte-specific completions.

🌟 Features

Automatic Detection
Activates only in Svelte projects and on .svelte files, minimizing performance impact.
